    "body": "I began this booklet by describing a point in time when I felt a desperate need to be a blessing to my children and how the practice of blessing grew out of that need. Today I feel less desperate, but more responsible than ever in the calling that is on my life to be a means of blessing to my children, my wife, and the brothers and sisters I am serving as a pastor. Regularly pronouncing blessings has given me a daily reminder that God is ultimately the One who will see to it that my loved ones are blessed, which is what helps minimize the desperation I feel.\n\n\t Blessings remind me that I can be an instrument of blessing, not only with a particular set of words and the laying on of a hand, but by the way I live my life and demonstrate my faith before those who are looking to me as an example. As you begin or continue in blessing others, I want to leave you with one of my favorite blessings that reflects my earnest prayer and desire that God use you to bless others with your words and with your life.",
