    "title" : "Responsibility and Authority to Bless",
    "body": "We saw in Numbers 6 that instructions concerning the blessing were directed specifically to the Levitical priesthood. This responsibility was reaffirmed in Deuteronomy 10:8 following the death of Aaron when “the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD to stand before the LORD to minister to him and to bless in his name, to this day,” and again in Deuteronomy 21:5 when Moses said to Israel “...the LORD your God has chosen [the sons of Levi] to minister to him and to bless in the name of the LORD.” (Emphasis added.)\n\n\tAlthough there are no comparable instructions to fathers, it is clear that the responsibility and authority to bless carried over into family life. It was usually the father who assumed the responsibility for blessing his children.\n\n\tFrom the biblical teaching and the examples we have observed, it seems reasonable that spiritual leaders in the home and church are free to and should be encouraged to pronounce blessings. Furthermore, if we consider the “priesthood” of all believers (1 Peter 2:5) and the general instructions given by Jesus and Paul (Luke 6:28; Romans 12:14), it seems that under the New Covenant any believer should feel the freedom to bless others in this way.\n\n\tSpiritual leaders in the home and the church should be encouraged to bless those they are called to lead. I believe the church is well-served when pastors, elders, small group leaders, ministry leaders, and Sunday school teachers bless those they are called to serve and lead. Similarly, I have witnessed the benefit to families and marriages when husbands and fathers make the effort to bless their wives and children. This resource has come from a desire that my brothers in Christ would join me in the practice of blessing, and then enjoy the fruits of blessing described in the next chapter.",
