    "body" : "1. Two things that I find important in blessing someone are eye contact and touch. I make every effort to look the people in the eye when I am blessing them. I use my eyes to communicate as much sincerity and love as I possibly can. Placing a hand on a person’s shoulder, head, or back is not only a way to communicate the affection that is often associated with the blessing, but it is also symbolic of “imparting” or “invoking” a blessing of God upon them. This same idea is communicated in group settings by lifting one or both hands over the group as the blessing is pronounced.\n\n2. I encourage people to memorize the blessings because it frees us to make eye contact with the people we are blessing, and it helps the words of blessing flow from the heart. Memorizing can be almost effortless if you are blessing someone daily.\n\n3. Some of the blessings in this collection are direct quotes from a portion of Scripture. Others were inspired by a text and adapted to fit a blessing format. Almost all of these blessings are the fruit of personal Bible reading and prayer when I was gripped by a specific truth or the promise and then turned it into a blessing. As you meditate on God’s Word, you will undoubtedly see things that will inspire you to pray for others. As God speaks to you through His Word consider turning His Word into a blessing, and watch God minister His blessing through you.",
