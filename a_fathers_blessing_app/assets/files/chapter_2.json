    "title" : "What is a Blessing",
    "body" : "Several months after I began regularly blessing my daughters, I was introduced to Rolf Garborg’s book, The Family Blessing.<sup>1</sup> Garborg not only gave me a biblical foundation for what I was discovering about the blessing, but he also inspired me with the experience and testimony of a man who had been blessing his children for more than 18 years. I urge aspiring “blessers” to read Garborg’s book for a much more thorough treatment of the subject than I will be able to provide in this guide.\n\n\tGarborg identifies four different categories of blessings in Scripture, one of which is “the blessing spoken by one person to another, often in the name of God.”<sup>2</sup> Garborg goes on to explain that within this category there is a general use of the word that simply means “to speak well of, to express praise.”<sup>3</sup> There is also a more specific use that defines blessing as “the intentional act of speaking God’s favor and power into someone’s life, often accompanied by a symbolic gesture such as laying hands on the person.”<sup>4</sup> This specific use of the word is what I have in mind as I encourage blessing in the church, and especially in Christian homes where it can become another significant way to nurture the faith of our children and bestow God’s blessing on their lives.",
